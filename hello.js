/*  
Welcome, new coder. 
Enter your code on line 7 to print 'Hello, World!' 
to the console (the panel on the right)
*/

console.log("Hello World!");
console.log("Hello LaunchCode!");//1. 
console.log("Hello World!");//2. Removing parenthesis gives syntax error: Unexpected string 
console.log('Hello World!');//3. gives error without one of quotations. Need to include both. No difference 
console.log("Hello World!")//4. Does print without the semicolon 
console.log(3);//5. 
console.log("Hello my name is Melissa\nHello Launchcode");//6.
console.log("Hello my name is Melissa. This is my first code.");//7. 
console.log('My favorite movie is "Finding" Nemo');//8.
console.log("My favorite number is" + 3);//9.

/*  
Next, PLAY! 
Modify your code on line 7 to try to accomplish the tasks listed below:

   1. Change the message that is printed.
   2. Figure out what the parentheses do. Will the code work without them?
   3. Remove one or both quotation marks. Do we need to include both opening and closing quote marks? Is there a difference between using a single or a double quote (' vs. ")?
   4. Remove the semi-colon, ;.
   5. Print a number. (Bonus: Print two numbers added together).
   6. Print multiple messages one after the other.
   7. Print two messages on the same line.
   8. Print a message that contains quote marks, such as Quoth the Raven "Nevermore".
   9. Other. You choose!
